# SLAC
Source code for simulations and experimentation during my SLAC internship. 

"PR.ipynb" is the complete application of 2D phase retrieval on experimental data from SLAC. We use the Strehl Ratio featured in "rgenesis_ks_strehl_Gaus_v2.ipynb" to measure how accurate our retrieval is. The other programs are my improved versions of traditional phase retrieval algorithms. "GS_Phase_Retrieval_Function_Fast.ipynb" simulates the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, "HIO_ER.m" and "HIO_ER.ipynb" simulate the Hybrid input-output + error reduction algorithm, and "OSS_revised_complex_gs.m" simulates the oversampling smoothness algorithm. The other files are added for the completeness of the topic.
